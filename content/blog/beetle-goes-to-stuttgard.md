In the evening of day three we went over the German border from Switzerland and headed to Stuttgard. On our way we booked a room at Hotel NH Stuttgard Airport since it had such a good review and did not cost us that much. The hotel was excellent except for the parking. We called ahead to make sure that they have secure parking available but when we came it was only secure in the sense that there was a payment gate so anyone could walk into the parking lot and start breaking windows. So we emptied the car completely and took all the luggage to the hotel room. After a hard driving day it was so good to lay down in a comfortable bed with perfect duvet and linen.

We slept really well and in the morning we packed the car and headed to Nuremberg.
