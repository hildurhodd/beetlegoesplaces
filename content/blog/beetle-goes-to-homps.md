We talked to our hosts in Sainte Helene about our itinerary and they recommended a detour to Homps to see the Canal du Midi. Seeing that Homps is only 5 minute drive from Olonzac, it made perfect sense to take the detour to see it.

Canal du Midi or the Canal of the two seas is 240 KM long and man made. It is considered to be the greatest construction work in the 17th century. The canal joins the Mediterranean sea to the Atlantic ocean.

This project was an utopian idea for years and finally in 1667 the construction began. The main purpose of this construction was to avoid the salt tax that they had to pay the Spaniards when crossing the Gibraltar strait. These waters were infested with pirates at this time and that caused tons of problems for trade ships, so this canal was a brilliant solution to this problem.

1681 the construction finally ended. Unfortunately the mastermind of the project, Pierre-Paul Riquet, was not able to live through the end because he died 8 months before the construction ended. This project depleted Riquet's personal fortune.

The canal has the worlds first navigable tunnel, The Malpas tunnel. It is 165 meters long with an arch 8 meters above the canal's surface.

As always, we took a look at the village's church. This is a Roman church named St. Etienne.

Another historical building is a commandery. The Homps commandery in now only a small part of what it has once been. It has been progressively been demolished over the centuries. There is only one wing left which is now divided into flats and a tower.

This village is really small but has a lot of history.
