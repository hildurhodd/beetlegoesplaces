The third day of the road trip went into just driving as far as we could towards Nuremberg where my brother lives and where the new window was going to be delivered. We decided to go through Switzerland since that was the original plan but skip a CERN tour and Lichtenstein. The window issue had put us back one and a half day so we did not stop for pictures anywhere in Switzerland we just drove through with a small detour through Geneva city.

This day we drove XXX km for XX hours and XX minutes.
