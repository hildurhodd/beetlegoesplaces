After driving from Luxembourg and through Belgium in nasty weather we booked our selfs into a hotel in Amsterdam, XO Hotel Pack West. The hotel was nice, 4 star, and with a fantastic private secure parking for the beetle.

We went straight out for a walk. There was almost an hour walk down town and on the way we saw boat houses along one of the canals. It was quite interesting to see.

Then we stoped at one bar to have some beers after the long drive.

There were a lot of interesting stores and specially cheese stores.

And there was even a whole store with one of my favourite cheese, Old Amsterdam.

We stopped at a restaurant named Grizzly Amsterdam and had some burgers. I can't say that they were the best I had but good to have a burger after the noodle soup the night before.

I find Amsterdam a charming city. Narrow streets, canals, bikes everywhere, small design shops and what I found most interesting were the crochet houses that have probably been sinking a little bit along all these years along the canals. We would like to visit this city again and spend more time there (and maybe in more daylight).
