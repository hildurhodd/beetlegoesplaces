Some weeks ago we booked a one night stay at a bed and breakfast in a village named Olonzac, in southern France, that our friend recommended. We were really excited to go there on the beetle and enjoy the beautiful view that south of France has to offer. Unfortunately we had to cancel the reservation due to my health. According to the booking site were we did the reservation we had to pay 30 EUR in cancelation fee but we received an email from the owners of the B&B informing us that they will not charge us the cancelation fee and a hope to see us sometime in the future. After reading the email we wanted more than anything to go there and stay for even longer period. So we ended up booking a room for 3 nights and we do not regret that decision.

The room is really romantic with the nicest bed, the bathroom is really large and the shower is so large that it can fit four people and with a rain shower head.

  The house it self is so beautifully renovated. They kept the French country charm both on the house itself and the decoration. To enter the house you walk through a big grape vine and a small charming court yard with flowers, tables and chairs. When you walk in you can see right a way the beautiful French decorations. There is a lounge area for the guests that is very inviting. The breakfast area is like a fine dining room with a small charming kitchen where the owners prepare the breakfast. There you can also find tons of brochures about neighbouring areas, teas, coffee, wines and a stocked fridge.

As mentioned before, the breakfast is made by the owners. They use local produce as much as they can and I have to say it was sooooo good, a perfect beginning of the day.

I saved the best for last. The owners, Kay and Mark, are the nicest people. They provide you with tons of information and recommendations about what to see and where to eat around the area. They hold a lot of knowledge about the country side of France and much further than that. After staying there and chatting with them for four days we feel like we have known them our whole life. We want to send them our best wishes and gratitude. I was only going to do one blog post about Beetle goes to Olonzac and mention the B&B but when I started writing I realized that I had content for a whole blog post for [Sainte Héléne Chambers d'hotes](https://www.sainte-helene.com/).
