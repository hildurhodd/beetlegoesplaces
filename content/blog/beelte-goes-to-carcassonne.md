Carcassonne is a beautiful fortified town in south of France. The medieval fortress was added to UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997. It is now probably the most visited tourist attraction in south of France and probably also one of the top tourist attractions in the whole of France out side of Paris. The tourism is the main income stream in Carcassonne along with manufacture and wine making.

There are 3 rivers that flow through the town, Aude, Fresquel and the Canal du Midi. Aude lies just beneath the root of the fortress and is 224km long. Its source is in the Pyrenees mountains and runs all the way to the Mediterranean Sea near Narbonne.

The fortress and the fortified city is absolutely worth the visit. I would recommend a visit in May since the tourist season has not really started yet but the wether is good. We were kind of shocked to see the amount of tourists walking around in this last visit.

The fortified city is guarded by two outer walls and 53 towers. The location was strategically chosen, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and because of that rulers were able to expand its fortifications drastically making it one of the largest in south of France. Carcassonne was in such a disrepair after being demilitarised under Napoleon that the government took a decision to demolish it, but fortunately people stood up against that decision and it restoration started in 1853.

The streets in the fortified city are charming with restaurants and gift shops.

There are several candy stores inside the fortress and we stepped into one of them and bought few peaces to eat in a romantic setting by the Aude river.

We saw some interesting vehicles when we walked down the hill from the fortress towards the river.

After spending some time by the Aude river we went to a restaurant named Brasserie 4. We visited this very same restaurant earlier this year and the food was so good that we decided to eat there again. We were not really hungry so we only went for cheeses and pate and it did not disappoint us.

The beetle looked so good in this medieval surroundings and we were fortunate to be able to snap some photos with her.

On our way back to the hotel we drove through one town where there were billions of large flies or small butterflies. When I was taking photos I could hear the crackling sound on the street when the flies were crushed by vehicles driving past me.
