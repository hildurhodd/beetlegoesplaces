Minerve is one of the most charming village that I have visited. It's history goes back to 46 BC where Minerve was a camp for the 10th Roman Legion.

Minerve was a powerful town during the medieval era where cathars lived. But in June 1210 the town was caught in the torments of the Crusade against the Albigeois. In 1209 Simon de Montfort, the military chief of the Crusade, ordered the destruction of the town by having catapults and birdtraps set up round the fortified town. Lack of water and supplies combined with the heat soon made the viscount of Minerve surrender.

The crusaders gave the cahtars no other choice but to change religion. But the Cathars refused to convert resulting in 140 cathars sentenced to be burnt at the stake.

Inside the village there is a church named Saint-Etienne that was built in the 11th and 12th century.

We are so used to the Spanish lunch time that we kind of missed the lunch traffic and were forced to eat at the only place that did not shut the door on us.

In a short walking distance there is a cave where the river that surrounded Minerve used to run through.

We loved walking around and enjoying the scenery.

And the Beetle looked absolutely fantastic in the medieval surroundings.

On our way back we stoped at a vinery named Chateou Cabezac. It has a friendly environment and staff where we were able to taste their fantastic vines for no charge. We are particularly fond of one of their rosey bottle. We ended up filling the trunk/bonnet of the beetle with red, white and rosey bottles.
