In the evening of day three we went over the German border from Switzerland and headed to Stuttgard. On our way we booked a room at Hotel NH Stuttgard Airport since it had such a good review and did not cost us that much. The hotel was excellent except for the parking. We called ahead to make sure that they have secure parking available but when we came it was only secure in the sense that there was a payment gate so anyone could walk into the parking lot and start breaking windows. So we emptied the car completely and took all the luggage to the hotel room. But we manage to see the beetle out of our hotel-room window.

After a hard driving day it was so good to lay down in a comfortable bed with perfect duvet and linen. We slept really well and in the morning we packed the car and headed to Nuremberg.

When we came to Nuremberg the windows had just arrived. Unfortunately little assembly was required since the rubber was separate. This job ended up being a 6 hour job.

But the good thing was that the car was safe and we were in the comfort of my brothers home. We spent the weekend with him and his family.

The weather was rather gloomy but we took a walk through the city centre and I managed to find a warm coat since mine had been stolen.

We want to express our gratitude to by brother and his lovely girlfriend for being there for us in the time of need :kiss: You guys made us feel so welcome and we managed to relax and enjoy every bit of this weekend.

Until next time :smile:
