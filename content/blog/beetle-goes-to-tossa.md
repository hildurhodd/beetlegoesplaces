We went on a day trip on the Beetle to a small town named Tossa de Mar, Catalonia, Spain, located on the Costa Brava. It is a charming town with a beautiful fortified medieval area from the 14th century. The city centre is a little crowded and full of tourist shops selling all kind of tourist merchandise but the Vila Vella and the beaches are really worth the visit. The narrow cobblestone streets, stone walls and the vegetation is very charming and peaceful.

There are 3 beaches in Tossa de Mar and all of them are really beautiful and the sea is so incredibly clear.

We set down for some drinks and food at the top of the fortress. I can not say that the food was all that good but the view was spectacular, the cliffs and the clear sea and to top it of they had the Icelandic flag right next to the Spanish one ;)
