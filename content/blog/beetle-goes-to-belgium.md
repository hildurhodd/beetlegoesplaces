After leaving Luxembourg we headed towards Belgium. The weather continued to be misty and rainy so we decided to skip the planned stop in Brussels. Also, the week before we spent almost a week in Belgium where we walked around Brussels and Antwerp.

We just stopped in a small town named Spa for a short break and then head to Netherlands.
