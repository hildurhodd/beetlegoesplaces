I have wanted to own a Volkswagen Beetle since I was a teenager. On the 29th of June 2017 that dream came true when my boyfriend gave me one as a birthday present.

We spent a lot of time surfing the internet and traveling around Spain in a rental car to find the right Beetle. We stumbled upon this white beautiful 1971 model of 1302 Super Beetle in Tarragona, Spain. The owner had restored this car beautifully, he had held on to the original character of the car and the engine sounded perfectly.

This was the car I wanted.

We went to pick it up on the 29th of June. The owner is a really nice man, he runs a restaurant/bar in Tarragona and had arranged everything for us so we only needed to take the train to Tarragona at a specific time to come and sign the papers and pick the Beetle up.

We are so excited about this car and the adventures ahead. We are planning on going on small trips around Spain and France and later this year we will go on a road trip through Europe. We are moving back to our home country, Iceland, so we will be traveling on the Beetle from Spain to Iceland. With this blog we are able to document our adventures and share them with friends and family.

What an awesome idea it is to travel around Europe on a 1971 model of VW Beetle.

Until next time :)
