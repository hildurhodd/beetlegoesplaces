We were recommended by the owners of the bed and breakfast we stayed at in Olonzac to visit a village named Lagrasse. This village is part of the [Les Plus Beaux Villages de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Plus_Beaux_Villages_de_France) association, which means "The most beautiful village of France" and was really worth the visit.

L'Orbieu is a river that is over 84km long that divides Lagrasse. On the right side there is the village and on the left bank there is an abbey/monastery. This abbey has history back to before the 8th century. According to a charter written in 779 AC a small abbey already existed in that spot. The village Lagrasse was then born out of its abbey.

A bridge between the village and the abbey that was built in 1303 is still a standing mediaeval civil engineering. It has 3 unequal archer an has been overhauled in the 17th and the 19 century. Unfortunately over the years it has lost 2 of it's 2 towers.

Another medieval civil engineering gem in Lagrasse is it's Market Hall, built on the Palace de la Halle in 1325. It has 10 stone pillars that holds it's timber roof. One of the pillars is sculpted with a coat of arms and it was good fun finding which one.

The view when we approached the village was spectacular.

We arrived to Lagrasse on a Sunday morning/noon and Unfortunately we experienced a parking dilemma. We walked to the village and there were a lot of people walking around and we saw that there was a market going on, selling all kinds of stuff.

As soon as we walked from the market street everything became much quieter. The old village it self is really charming with narrow streets and old houses.

In the heart of the old village is a beautiful church that is the only example of a single-nave Gothic church in the region. It was build between 1359 and 1398. This parish church is listed as a historical building and its site is protected.

There is a funny walkway from the back of the church to the main entrance today, which is a side entrance.

As mentioned above there is a historical monastery on the other side of the river.

We set down for lunch in a restaurant called L'Affenage and decided to go for a menu meal. The food was good but the portions were so huge that we were stuffed even though we didn't finish half of the plates. I got tomato and mozzarella and Arnar got a mix of cold cuts as a primary dish. For the main dish I chose baked camembert and Arnar chose a steak. We got a cheese platter between the main course and the desert. We were so stuffed that I can hardly remember the desert.

And we found a boyfriend for the beetle :smile:

All in all a great experience and a lot to see. There was plenty of parking spaces and people were relaxed and seemed to enjoy them selves. People were cooling down in the river, walking through the market and visiting the abbey.
