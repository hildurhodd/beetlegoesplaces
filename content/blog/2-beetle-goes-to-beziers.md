After a short stop in Figueres, Spain, we headed to France. We had a short break and fuelled up just outside of a town named Béziers.

And afterwards we drove through the old centre of Béziers and managed to take some photos of the beetle with a beautiful background. In the background you see the Saint-Nazaire cathedral in gothic style from the 14th century.

The beetle just keeps on going without problems. This was the last pitstop before our end-destination for this first day of 16.

Next up: Montpellier, France.

Until next time :smile:
