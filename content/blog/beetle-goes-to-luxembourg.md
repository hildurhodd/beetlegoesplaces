After a good weekend in nuremberg we headed to Luxembourg with a new window. We decided to stay in the country side rather than in the city.

We booked a night at a chateau in the north part of the country.

When we arrived we were asked if we want to participate in the Gala dinner. We kind of laughed inside us since all of our better clothes had been robbed. So we just stayed in the room that night except we first walked around and found a bar in the cellar that had an original NES computer (Nintendo Entertainment System). So we played Super Mario Bros in the dungeon of the castle before spending the night with noodle soup in our room.

In the morning we managed to take some pictures of the beetle in front of the castle.

Unfortunately we did not get a good weather. There was a fog and rain ever since we came to Germany. So we just kept on going.

Until next time :smile:
