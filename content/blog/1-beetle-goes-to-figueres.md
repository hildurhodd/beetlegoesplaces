Finally the journey that we have been waiting for starts. We have stuffed the car with our belongings in Barcelona and headed towards our home country, Iceland.

We took some pictures of the beetle, ready to go, in front of our apartment building.

And of course since we live just by the beach we had to have one of the beetle with a sea view.

And here is when the beetle leaves Barcelona.

First pitstop on out first day is Figueres, Spain. The distance from Barcelona to Figueres is 136 KM and it took us 2 hours and 6 minutes to drive.

Fugueres is a town in Catalonia, Spain, and is the birthplace of the artist Salvador Dalí. The Dalí Theatre and Museum, which Dalí him self designed, is the main attraction of this town. It holds the largest and most diverse collection of Salvador Dalí's work and Dalí himself is buried in a crypt there below the stage.

> I want my museum to be a single block, a labyrinth, a great surrealist object. It will be totally theatrical museum. The people who come to see it will leave with the sensation of having had a theatrical dream.

>— Salvador Dalí

We only stoped in Figueres to stretch, buy snack for the road and take pictures of the beetle by the beautiful Dalí museum.
