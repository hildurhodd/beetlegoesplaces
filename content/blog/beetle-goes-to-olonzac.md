Some weeks ago we booked a one night stay at a bed and breakfast in a village named Olonzac, in southern France, that our friend recommended. We were really excited to go there on the beetle and enjoy the beautiful view that south of France has to offer. Unfortunately we had to cancel the reservation due to my health. According to the booking site were we did the reservation we had to pay 30 EUR in cancelation fee but we received an email from the owners of the B&B informing us that they will not charge us the cancelation fee and a hope to see us sometime in the future. After reading the email we wanted more than anything to go there and stay for even longer period. So we ended up booking a room for 3 nights and we do not regret that decision.
