Last September it was time to bring the beetle to MOT inspection, or ITV as it is called in Spain. We brought it to a mechanic first go over it and I have to say that the mechanic was so happy to get this beautiful car to his garage.
We had to change the suspension and while we had the suspension apart we had a look at the breaks and decided to change the break disks and break pads as well as the front wheal bearings. And by doing this the beetle passed the inspection and made us more comfortable starting our road trip to Iceland. The car is in a perfect condition and we feel so lucky to have found and purchased this fantastic car.

To make more room for our luggage we bought a roof rack. It is a nice vintage looking rack that fits the stile of the beetle perfectly. The rack came to good use when we had to bring our television to a transport company located near the airport.
