The reason for us not traveling lately is that I have been sick. The beetle has truly been a Super beetle, getting me to and from the hospital for many days.

I have to tell you about a parking garage in Sanitas Hospital Cima. Each time we parked there we saw expensive supercars, which does not surprise me because it has the cleanest floors I have ever seen, and they are white!

To go to the hospital is over an hour trip with the underground system so to be able to drive to and from the hospital saved us a lot of time and we were able to enjoy a much better view:

Next road trip will be to Olonzac, France. We have booked a hotel and we will be staying there for four days eating cheeses and drinking wine (and taking tons of pictures to share with you all) and hopefully we will also be able to visit towns nearby as well.

Until next time (OLONZAC) :)
